-- | = The data functor hierarchy
--
-- This module defines the data functor library. Unlike in the case of
-- non-linear, unrestricted, functors, there is a split between data functors,
-- which represent containers, and control functors which represent effects.
-- Please read this
-- [blog post](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2020-01-16-data-vs-control.html).
-- For more details, see "Control.Functor.Linear".
--
-- * Linear data functors should be thought of as containers of data.
-- * Linear data applicative functors should be thought of as containers
-- that can be zipped.
-- * Linear data traversable functors should be thought of as
-- containers which store a finite number of values.
